A template for a ready-to-publish [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) component. Makes use of [Sveltekit's packaging](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging) feature.

## Get started

You can use GitHub's handy "Use this template" feature, which opens a new repo based on this template. You could do this manually as well:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/himynameisdave/svelte-component-template

# Rename it
mv ./svelte-component-template ./svelte-my-component

# Change into that dir
cd ./svelte-my-component

# Remove the git history for this template
rm -rf ./.git/

# Start a new git history
git init

# Add the changes
git add .

# Commit them
git commit -m "‚ú® Initial commit"
```

## Developing

For building your component/library, you can mostly just follow the guidelines outlined in [Sveltekit's packaging](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging) documentation.

The best part about this approach is that you get a "playground" to test your component: everything in `lib/routes/` operates like a typical Sveltekit app, and you can pull in your component to test here in the browser.

## Testing

This is set up to use [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing and [`playwright`](https://playwright.dev/) for integration testing. Playwright tests will run against the `lib/routes/` project.

Linting is handled by [`eslint-config-himynameisdave`](https://github.com/himynameisdave/eslint-config-himynameisdave).

## Publishing

You can publish your component/library to NPM via the `release` command:

```bash
# Should use npm instead of yarn for this
npm run release
```

This will first build your package and test that everything is ready to publish. You will be prompted for info about the release, including your NPM 2FA password.
